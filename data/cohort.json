            "bio": "<p>On my 19th birthday I was given my very first Rubik's cube puzzle. I grabbed it and instantly began solving it. I worked at it non-stop for hours without any breaks.Â I was obsessed with it. After completing it, I realized how much time had gone by without a care in the world. I remember wishing work was like that. The lesson I learned from the puzzle was that I enjoy thinking and solving problems. If I could find a job where I could think and solve problems, work would fly by and I would enjoy myself. I contemplated for some time and decided to look into programming. Programming was a perfect fit for this passion I had found within myself. I began teaching myself how to program software, and even though it was very difficult at first, I became decent enough to begin thinking about a career in software development. This led me to Nashville Software School. The time Iâve spent building software and web applications, have been some of the most rewarding and enjoyable times of my life.</p>",

In the years since college, my life has been filled with exciting moments as well as moments of questioning whether the up and down nature of a career in music was best for me. I had heard positive rumblings about Nashville Software School and decided to make the leap. What immediately drew me to software development was the focus on continual learning and growth. This spoke to my curiosity. What then captured me further was similar to what I have always loved about music - there is nothing more fulfilling than making something out of nothing. I am proud to consider myself a software developer and am thankful for the path that brought me here.</p>",

After six successful years selling SaaS at ADP and insurance at Brown & Brown I found web development through a contact of mine, and immediately started learning everything I could on various websites like Udemy, Freecodecamp and SoloLearn. I fell in love with coding after a year of learning and building my own projects and decided to solidify my education at Nashville Software School. During my education so far, I've learned not just about coding, but also what it takes to work with a team of developers to build a functional product.</p>",
